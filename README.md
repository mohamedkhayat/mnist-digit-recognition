# mnist-digit-recognition
This project is a digit recognition system using a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits in a PyGame window, and the model will recognize the drawn digit. This project was created as a learning exercise to apply concepts from an intro to deep learning course and to incorporate an interactive element to the models
