# mnist-digit-recognition
This project is a digit recognition system using a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits in a PyGame window, and the model will recognize the drawn digit. This project was created as a learning exercise to apply concepts from an intro to deep learning course and to incorporate an interactive element to the models

Dependencies should be pytorch torchvision pygame pillow just run python3 run.py and draw a digit from 0 to 9, try to make it big and in the middle so that the model has an easier time to detect it
